# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues for `mdd` are managed as GitHub issues on `schubergphilis/mdd`, the
same remote as the source code.

Use the `gh` CLI for all operations. The working tree has several remotes
(`gitlab`, `lsimons`, `bot`), so pass `-R schubergphilis/mdd` explicitly
rather than relying on `gh` picking the right one:

```bash
gh -R schubergphilis/mdd issue list --label needs-triage
gh -R schubergphilis/mdd issue view <number>
gh -R schubergphilis/mdd issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label needs-triage
gh -R schubergphilis/mdd issue edit <number> --add-label ready-for-agent --remove-label needs-triage
```

`gh issue --help` documents the rest.

Do not put a closing keyword (`closes #NNN`, `fixes #NNN`) in a commit that
lands directly on `main` — it auto-closes the issue before the work is
reviewed. Put it in the pull request body instead.

Dependabot maintains `dependencies`, `python`, `python:uv` and
`github_actions` on its own pull requests. Do not apply those by hand.

## Triage flow

1. A new issue gets `needs-triage`.
2. A maintainer adds a kind label (`bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation`).
3. If the report is incomplete, `needs-info` replaces `needs-triage` until
   the reporter answers.
4. Once the issue states what to change and how to verify it, it becomes
   `ready-for-agent` (an autonomous agent can take it end to end) or
   `ready-for-human` (it needs judgement, a live service, or Microsoft
   Office on macOS that an agent does not have).
5. `wontfix` closes it with a written reason.

An issue that would need a design decision is not `ready-for-agent`. It
needs a spec in `docs/spec/` first — see
[`000-specs.md`](../spec/000-specs.md).
